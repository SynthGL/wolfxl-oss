# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- `calculate()` now honors the workbook's 1904 date system for date and time
  functions and date-valued cells, keeping formula serials and comparisons
  consistent with the workbook epoch.

## 2.0.6

### Changed

- The README, PyPI description, and package summary lead with preservation
  and speed (7-14x faster than openpyxl on most reads and writes) and describe
  `calculate()` as covering common functions only. Metadata only; the
  package code is unchanged from 2.0.5.

## 2.0.5

### Added

- Prebuilt musllinux wheels for x86_64 and aarch64, so `pip install wolfxl`
  on Alpine and other musl-based distributions no longer builds from source.

### Changed

- The README, PyPI description, and package summary now lead with editing
  existing Excel files without losing formatting, with an edit example and an
  openpyxl comparison.

## 2.0.4

### Fixed

- Tables loaded in modify mode now grow on save. Changing `table.ref` and
  appending `TableColumn` entries rewrites the existing table part: its range,
  its autoFilter range, and its column list. Previously these edits were
  silently dropped. Moving a table's top-left cell, or a range whose width
  does not match the column list, raises `ValueError` on save.

## 2.0.3

### Fixed

- `calculate()` and `recalculate()` no longer raise `TypeError` on loaded
  workbooks that contain defined names. The evaluator now reads each name's
  reference text, so formulas such as `=SUM(Sales)*Rate` calculate and
  propagate changes through the name.

## 2.0.2

### Changed

- Corrected PyPI release copy: removed obsolete pre-launch language and pinned the
  installation command to `wolfxl==2.0.2`.
- Canonicalized public GitHub links to `SynthGL/wolfxl-oss` after the repository
  rename.
- Updated package metadata and documentation only; this release contains no code
  changes.
